"""Demonstrate the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) system."""

# The Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) system:
#    u_t = -u*u_x - u_xx - u_xxxx,
#    where x âˆˆ [0, L],  periodic BCs,
# is the simplest (?) PDE that admits chaos (requires L>=12?):
#
# Its numerical solution is best undertaken
# with Fourier decomposition for the spatial variable.
# According to kassam2005fourth:
# - The equation is stiff, due to higher-order linear terms:
#    - the diffusion term acts as an energy source,
#      causing instability of high-order (large-scale Fourier) modes.
#    - the hyper-diffusion term yields stability of the low-order modes.
# - The nonlinear term induces mixing of the (Fourier) modes.
#
# bocquet2019consistency use it with DA because:
# "it is characterised by sharp density gradients
# so that it may be expected that local EnKFs are prone to imbalance"
#
# hickmann2017multiresolution use it with DA becaues:
# "[The mixing allows us to] investigate the effect of
# propagating scale-dependent information through the EnKF."
#
# www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Kuramoto-Sivashinsky_equation:
# Number of unstable modes almost directly proportional to L?
#
# Applications:
# - modeling hydrodynamic stability of laminar flame fronts
# - instabilities in thin films and the flow of a viscous fluid down a vertical plane
# - etc
#
# It can be observed in the plots that sharpness from ICs
# remain in the system for a long time (for ever?).
