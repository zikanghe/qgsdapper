"""Linear advection (i.e. translation) in 1D.

Optimal solution provided by Kalman filter (ExtKF).
System is typically used with a relatively large size (Nx=1000),
but initialized with a moderate wavenumber (k),
which a DA method should hopefully be able to exploit.

The system (and the impact on the DA) can also be adjusted by
selecting non-optimal time steps, and/or various noise configs.

A summary for the purpose of DA is provided in section 3.3 of thesis found at
ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:9f9961f0-6906-4147-a8a9-ca9f2d0e4a12
