def pairwise_distances(A, B=None, domain=None):
    """Euclidian distance (not squared) between pts. in `A` and `B`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    A: array of shape (nPoints, nDims).
        A collection a points.

    B:
        Same as `A`, but nPoints can differ.

    domain: tuple
        Assume the domain is a **periodic** hyper-rectangle whose
        edges along dimension `i` span from 0 to `domain[i]`.
        NB: Behaviour not defined if `any(A.max(0) > domain)`, and likewise for `B`.

    Returns
    -------
    Array of of shape `(nPointsA, nPointsB)`.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> A = [[0, 0], [0, 1], [1, 0], [1, 1]]
    >>> with np.printoptions(precision=2):
    ...     print(pairwise_distances(A))
    [[0.   1.   1.   1.41]
     [1.   0.   1.41 1.  ]
     [1.   1.41 0.   1.  ]
     [1.41 1.   1.   0.  ]]

    The function matches `pdist(..., metric='euclidean')`, but is faster:
    >>> from scipy.spatial.distance import pdist, squareform
    >>> (pairwise_distances(A) == squareform(pdist(A))).all()
    True

    As opposed to `pdist`, it also allows comparing `A` to a different set of points,
    `B`, without the augmentation/block tricks needed for pdist.

    >>> A = np.arange(4)[:, None]
    >>> pairwise_distances(A, [[2]]).T
    array([[2., 1., 0., 1.]])

    Illustration of periodicity:
    >>> pairwise_distances(A, domain=(4, ))
    array([[0., 1., 2., 1.],
           [1., 0., 1., 2.],
           [2., 1., 0., 1.],
           [1., 2., 1., 0.]])

    NB: If an input array is 1-dim, it is seen as a single point.
