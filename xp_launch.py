    Parameters
    ----------
    HMM: HiddenMarkovModel

    xp: object
        Type: a `dapper.da_methods.da_method`-decorated class.

    This involves steps similar to `examples/basic_1.py`, i.e.:

    - `xp.assimilate`            : run DA, pass on exception if fail_gently

    - `xp.avrgs.tabulate`        : result printing
    - `dill.dump`                : result storage

    Parameters
    ----------
    xp: object
        Type: a `dapper.da_methods.da_method`-decorated class.
    label: str
        Name attached to progressbar during assimilation.
    savedir: str
        Path of folder wherein to store the experiment data.
    HMM: HiddenMarkovModel
        Container defining the system.
    setup: function
        This function must take two arguments: `HMM` and `xp`,
        and return the `HMM` to be used by the DA methods
        (typically the same as the input `HMM`, but could be modified),
        and the (typically synthetic) truth and obs time series.

        This gives you the ability to customize almost any aspect of the
        individual experiments within a batch launch of experiments.
        Typically you will grab one or more parameter values
        stored in the `xp` (see `dapper.da_methods.da_method`) and act on them,
        or set them in some other object that impacts the experiment.
        Thus, by generating a new `xp` for each such parameter value you can
        investigate the impact/sensitivity of the results to this parameter.
        Examples include:

        - Setting the seed. See the default `setup`, namely `seed_and_simulate`,
          for how this is done.
        - Setting some aspect of the `HMM` such as the observation noise,
          or the interval between observations.
        - Setting some parameter of the model (not otherwise detailed in the `HMM`).
          For example, the `Force` parameter of `dapper.mods.Lorenz96`, as done in
          see `examples/basic_3`.
        - Using a different `HMM` entirely for the truth/obs (`xx`/`yy`) generation,
          than the one that will be used by the DA. Or loading the truth/obs
          time series from file. In both cases, you might also have to do some
          cropping or slicing of `xx` and `yy` before returning them.
    free: bool
        Whether (or not) to `del xp.stats` after the experiment is done,
        so as to free up memory and/or not save this data
        (just keeping `xp.avrgs`).
    statkeys: list
        A list of names (possibly in the form of abbreviations) of the
        statistical averages that should be printed immediately afther
        this xp.
    fail_gently: bool
        Whether (or not) to propagate exceptions.

class xpList(list):
    """Subclass of `list` specialized for experiment ("xp") objects.

    Main use: administrate experiment launches.

    Modifications to `list`:

    - `xpList.append` supports `unique` to enable lazy `xp` declaration.
    - `__iadd__` (`+=`) supports adding single `xp`s.
      this is hackey, but convenience is king.
    - `__getitem__` supports lists, similar to `np.ndarray`
    - `__repr__`: prints the list as rows of a table,
      where the columns represent attributes whose value is not shared among all `xp`s.
      Refer to `xpList.prep_table` for more information.

    Add-ons:

    - `xpList.launch`: run the experiments in current list.
    - `xpList.prep_table`: find all attributes of the `xp`s in the list;
      classify as distinct, redundant, or common.
    - `xpList.gen_names`: use `xpList.prep_table` to generate
      a short & unique name for each `xp` in the list.
    - `xpList.tabulate_avrgs`: tabulate time-averaged results.
    - `xpList.inds` to search by kw-attrs.

    Parameters
    ----------
    args: entries
        Nothing, or a list of `xp`s.

    unique: bool
        Duplicates won't get appended. Makes `append` (and `__iadd__`) relatively slow.
        Use `extend` or `__add__` or `combinator` to bypass this validation.

    Also see
    --------
    - Examples: `examples/basic_2`, `examples/basic_3`
    - `dapper.xp_process.xpSpace`, which is used for experient result **presentation**,
      as opposed to this class (`xpList`), which handles **launching** experiments.

    This is a good deal more efficient than relying on `xpList`'s `unique`. Parameters

    - not found among the args of the given DA method are ignored by `for_params`.
    - specified as keywords to the `for_params` fix the value

        but you forget that they are also attributes some method where you don't
